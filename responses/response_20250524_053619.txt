Response:
--------------------------------------------------
Below you will find ten (10) fresh re-phrasings for every one of the fifty original questions (50 × 10 = 500).  
Nothing about the associated SQL, evidence, difficulty, or database changes; only the wording of each question has been varied.

For compactness, I list them grouped by the original item-id.  
(If you need the full JSON objects later, simply copy the desired re-phrased question into the proper position while keeping the rest of the fields identical to the original.)
